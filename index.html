                    <p>There were some new ideas about the project, we mainly thought big here and started laying <br>
                       out what the project may need. We were able to get this rough skeleton after each person wrote <br>
                       down what they though was necessary to the project.</p>

                <h4>Extra Comments (Q & A)</h4>
                <p>Some questions were asked after the meeting. The questions are listed down below.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>When are we going to start coding on the project?</summary>
                    We will be starting the coding part in about 2-3 weeks, the latest.
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Why do we have to wait so long to start coding?</summary>
                    We need to make a thorough plan before we move forward. What's the point of jumping into the code <br>
                    if we don't even know what <em>exactly</em> we need to code? We don't want to start coding and realize <br>
                    that we added something extra and then delete it, or that we half-assed the code and added something too <br>
                    basic or quickly without thinking.
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Your name sounds very similar. Is it like the composer?</summary>
                    No, my name is <strong>Ludvig</strong>, with a <b>v</b>. My name is <strong>not</strong> like the composer. <br>
                    And no, it's not like the streamer either.
